  <br>I still recall the taste of your tears</br>
<br>Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears</br>
<br>My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore</br>
<br>Scraping through my head 'til I don't wanna sleep anymore</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I'm down to just one thing</br>
<br>And I'm starting to scare myself</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go way</br>
<br>I just want something</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
<br>You always were the one to show me how</br>
<br>Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now</br>
<br>This thing is slowly taking me apart</br>
<br>Grey would be the color if I had a heart</br>
<br>Come on and tell me</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I'm down to just one thing</br>
<br>And I'm starting to scare myself</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I just want something</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
<br>In this place it seems like such a same</br>
<br>Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same</br>
<br>Everywhere I look, you're all I see</br>
<br>Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be</br>
<br>Come on and tell me</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I'm down to just one thing</br>
<br>And I'm starting to scare myself</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go way</br>
<br>I just want something</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>

 </hr>
 <hr>
 <p>
 you know what i believe? that im not like anyone else. god, people sucks. humanity sucks. now, for a long time, i've felt so different compared to all the other mortals walking on earth.
 one thing i shall' make clear for you; i hate everyone. i hate myself. i hate YOU. yet, i rule. i am the only one with common sense, it seems... how often is it that you meet someone that thinks just like you?
 not often, it seems. god, its "oh but he's a ______" (politics) I DONT FUCKIN CARe, let me tell u one thing. if you're a teenager, you dont have to fucking care about politics. now, okay, thats my opinion.
 but its fucking valid i'll tell u that u fucking morons. "oh ur selfish if you're above 13 and isnt educated on politics/dont care about politics" god why dont u FUCKING KILL YOURSELF, i would want nothing more than
 watch them get their head blown offs. i'd do it myself actually. just fucking wait, this world is to be doomed anyways. everyones time will come, i'll make sure of it
