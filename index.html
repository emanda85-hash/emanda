 <br>
 its 22.24, ive just washed my face and brushed my teeth. im watching mello. did you know that eurovision is very niche in USA?
 </hr>
 <hr>
 <p>
 you know what i believe? that im not like anyone else. god, people sucks. humanity sucks. now, for a long time, i've felt so different compared to all the other mortals walking on earth.
 one thing i shall' make clear for you; i hate everyone. i hate myself. i hate YOU. yet, i rule. i am the only one with common sense, it seems... how often is it that you meet someone that thinks just like you?
 not often, it seems. god, its "oh but he's a ______" (politics) I DONT FUCKIN CARe, let me tell u one thing. if you're a teenager, you dont have to fucking care about politics. now, okay, thats my opinion.
 but its fucking valid i'll tell u that u fucking morons. "oh ur selfish if you're above 13 and isnt educated on politics/dont care about politics" god why dont u FUCKING KILL YOURSELF, i would want nothing more than
 watch them get their head blown offs. i'd do it myself actually. just fucking wait, this world is to be doomed anyways. everyones time will come, i'll make sure of it

<br>today ive cleande my cd stand cus it was dusty and had tape on that i got rid off. did you know i have lots of best of (XXXX) cds? i got....1995,1996 and 1997. then 2000 and more recent ones. alr, im still coughing (i have a cold)
and its horrible, my asthma isnt helping it at all. ASTHMA SUCKS ASS!!!!! dude, i caaannot wait to drink those energy drinks. theyre so fuckin ' delicious. anyways, before i go to sleep, i just remembered to play postal.
im close to finishing the game again. soon.... its a real fun game. so is doom. man, if only reality was like that.... i'd kill to be able to run around w' guns and whatever else. oh man, armor and power ups. thats what i want.

hi people, emanda is here again.
<br>so, right now its 12 am. im on call with a friend, we're playing the outlast trials... his name is teo. he's playing the tutorial right now.....iwas playing postal earlier to pass time but god..... it got so boring..... you know
this summer im gonna try applying for air rifle shooting. that would be so fun...... i've held in fake guns before in realistic size, and man, it feels so gud..... you know, firearms has always been something pleasing for me....
its the design, and purpose..... it has a different purpose for everyone.... self defense, killing, just to have on de wall......yu get it. they're so beautiful, and the sounds when the gun is going off.... you know something horrible with it?
if something like in pulp fiction would happen, you know the scene in the car with vincent and jules, and vincent's gun accidentally goes off....man, that'd be horrific! dont want that happening to me....;-)</br>
<br>welp, teo heard me typing.....told him im working on some html stuff......its so fun. especially when u can make your own diary just like this. or whatever you'd call it.</br>
</div>
</hr>
<div>
 <hr>
 <p>
so, folks. ive done quite a change to my webstie... now yu might wonder, "yo, wheres all the artists yu recmomended?" or "why'd the change of lyrics?" so is it that my friends want to see my website. I do not like sharing stuff with poeople.....other than people i dont know that are reading this.
  but, im sure this will be better.....maybe there will be another website, check where you're clicking.... you might be lucky and find the spot where yu redirect to another website of mine....;)good luck!
