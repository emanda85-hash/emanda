  <br>I still recall the taste of your tears</br>
<br>Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears</br>
<br>My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore</br>
<br>Scraping through my head 'til I don't wanna sleep anymore</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I'm down to just one thing</br>
<br>And I'm starting to scare myself</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go way</br>
<br>I just want something</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
<br>You always were the one to show me how</br>
<br>Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now</br>
<br>This thing is slowly taking me apart</br>
<br>Grey would be the color if I had a heart</br>
<br>Come on and tell me</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I'm down to just one thing</br>
<br>And I'm starting to scare myself</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I just want something</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
<br>In this place it seems like such a same</br>
<br>Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same</br>
<br>Everywhere I look, you're all I see</br>
<br>Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be</br>
<br>Come on and tell me</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>I'm down to just one thing</br>
<br>And I'm starting to scare myself</br>
<br>You make this all go away</br>
<br>You make this all go way</br>
<br>I just want something</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
<br>I just want something I can never have</br>
